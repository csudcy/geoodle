**Find places to meet people!**

Cool things which inspired me or I'm making use of in this project (in no particular order):

* [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons/) - cool icons
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - excellent hosting service (free tier is perfect for small apps)
* [Emitter](https://github.com/component/emitter) - add events to your JS objects
