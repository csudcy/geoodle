# Geoodle

**Find places to meet people!**

Have you ever used [doodle.com](https://doodle.com) (the most **awesome** event planning service ever)? Ever sorted out the date then had arguments about where to go? That's where geoodle comes in!


# Shoutouts

Cool things which inspired me or I'm making use of in this project (in no particular order):
* [doodle.com](https://doodle.com) - the most **awesome** event planning service ever
* [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons/) - cool icons
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - excellent hosting service (free tier is perfect for small apps)
* [Emitter](https://github.com/component/emitter) - add events to your JS objects


# TODO

* ~~MVP:~~
  * ~~A map~~
  * ~~Click to add points~~
  * ~~Click points to remove them~~
  * ~~Shows the geographical midpoint~~
  * ~~Client-side only (state is in the URL)~~
* Login (by name to start with, by social login later)
  * Later: Set your mode of transport
* Create a geopoll
* Add various points to the map:
  * ~~Anywhere you would like to be near (home, work, stations you pass through etc.)~~
  * ~~Suggestions of where to go~~
  * Add descriptions for points/suggestions
  * Later: Search for places
* ~~Geoodle will tell you the central point of all locations~~
* You can add suggestions of where to go
  * Later: Show approximate transport times/routes
* People can vote on which suggestions they like (or refuse to go to!)
* Make loading more robust

Things which might come later:

* Multiple polls on a single map
* Discussions?
