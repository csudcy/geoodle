# Geoodle

**Find places to meet people!**

Have you ever used [doodle.com](https://doodle.com) (the most **awesome** event planning service ever)? Ever sorted out the date then had arguments about where to go? That's where geoodle comes in!


# TODO

* Login (by name to start with, by social login later)
  * Later, you will be able to set your mode of transport
* Create a geopoll
* Add various points to the map:
  * Anywhere you would like to be near (home, work, stations you pass through etc.)
  * Suggestions of where to go
* Geoodle will tell you the central point of all locations
* You can add suggestions of where to go
  * Later, you will be shown approx transport times/routes
* People can vote on which suggestions the like (or refuse to go to!)
